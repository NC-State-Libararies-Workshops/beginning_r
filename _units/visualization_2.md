Next we'll be exploring the **ggplot2** package to create some visualizations. 
While **ggplot2** is very popular, its best to think of it as the core to a cluster of 
extensions. In fact, **ggplot2** refers to itself as belonging to the **tidyverse** ecosystem.
You don't need to know too much about that except that at its core, **tidyverse** is 
committed to writing R packages with common APIs (ways of communicating with  
functions) and a shared philosophy of how things should work. The benefit to you is 
that typically everything in the **ggplot2** ecosystem works pretty much the same 
way so you don't have to spend a lot of time learning how each function works.

Each **ggplot2** plot starts with creating a `ggplot()` object. A `ggplot()` contains
data and an aesthetic (`aes()`) that describes how to use the data. Then you just
keep adding layers onto it with other functions to create your desired visualization.

This may sound complicated and foreign to you at first. However, with a little 
experience (and time spent wrestling wiht other graphics functions and packages that 
don't work this way), most people come to see the elegance of using **ggplot2**.

To get started, lets do a very simple plot. First off we are going to see a third
way to get the `mtcars` data to generate nice labels. This time converting the 
numeric categories into labeled factors. 


```r

mtcars$gear <- factor(mtcars$gear,levels=c(3,4,5),
                      labels=c("3gears","4gears","5gears"))
mtcars$am <- factor(mtcars$am,levels=c(0,1),
                    labels=c("Automatic","Manual"))
mtcars$cyl <- factor(mtcars$cyl,levels=c(4,6,8),
                     labels=c("4cyl","6cyl","8cyl"))
mtcars$vs <- factor(mtcars$vs, levels = c(0,1), labels = c("V-shaped", "Straight"))

View(mtcars)

```

Then we'll make our `ggplot()` object. Lets look at horsepower and mpg first.

```r 

> mt_plot <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg))
> mt_plot + geom_point()  # This tells ggplot to create a scatter point plot

```

<figure>
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot1.png" alt="A simple scatter point plot" width="60%" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 1 - A simple scatter point plot using **ggplot2**.</figcaption>
</figure>


We can add more information into the graph. Lets make the size of the points 
dependedent on the Displacement, the shape of the point dependent on the transmission,
and the color depend on the weight.

```r 

> mt_plot <- ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x=hp, y=mpg, size = disp, shape = am, color = wt))
> mt_plot <- geom_point()   # This add geom_point() to the plot
> mt_plot   # This displays the plot

```

<figure>
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot2.png" alt="Scatter point plot with more data displayed" width="60%" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 2 - A scatter plot using color, size and shape to  visualize more information.</figcaption>
</figure>

Notice **ggplot2** does a lot for you, such as adding legends, and automically scaling
the size of the points. You can override those defaults as well.

You can keep adding additional layers, given that they work with your aesthetic. Essentially each geom_x,
theme_x or stat_x will refine or change the existing plot. However, not everything 
will work so it can take some trial and error along with some searching on the web. The next
chart doesn't really seem to add much, but its a good example of adding geoms to a plot.

```r

> mt_plot + geom_density_2d()

> mt_plot + stat_ellipse()

```
<div class="row">
<figure class="two column">
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot_density.png" alt="Density contour plot" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 3 - Adding density contours to the plot.</figcaption>
</figure>
<figure class="two column">
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot_ellipse.png" alt="Scatter point plot with more data displayed" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 4 - Adding confidnece ellipses to teh plot.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

Fitting lines to the plot is often helpful. 

```r 

> mt_plot <- mt_plot + geom_smooth(method = lm, se = FALSE) 
> mt_plot

```

<figure>
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot_smooth.png" alt="Scatter point plot with trend lines" width="60%" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 5 - The plot with trendlines added for transmission type.</figcaption>
</figure>

Once we get the content how we like it we can address more stylistic issues. First lets 
do labels and titles.

```r

# Notice the indenting to make it easier to read and edit. This is a common style,
# there are others too. The most important thing is to be consistent.
> mt_plot <- mt_plot + scale_colour_gradient("Weight \n 1000lbs") + 
                       scale_shape("Transmission") + 
                       scale_size_continuous("Displacement\ncu.in.") + 
                       scale_x_continuous("Horsepower") + 
                       scale_y_continuous("Miles per Gallon") + 
                       ggtitle("Motor Trend Cars Analysis")
> mt_plot

```

<figure>
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/ggplot_legends.png" alt="Legends have been fixed" width="60%" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 6 - The plot with legends improved.</figcaption>
</figure>

We can also use some themes with `ggthemes`. If it isn't installed and loaded do so 
first. This package has some preset themes that can probably make your chart cleaner 
and more stylish. Below are some you can try.

```r

> mt_plot + theme_classic()
> mt_plot + theme_tufte()
> mt_plot + theme_clean()
> mt_plot + theme_economist()
> mt_plot + theme_fivethirtyeight()

> mt_plot <- mt_plot + theme_tufte()
> mt_plot

```

The tufte theme is derived from some classic books and thinking by Edward Tufte. His 
general philosophy is that your visualizations should have the minimal amount of ink
to convey the story your graphic is trying tell. Anything else should be eliminated. As
you can see below, a lot of what we might normally see in a graph is eliminated.



Now that we have the plot we want we can save it.

```r

ggsave("my_final_plot.png")

```

<figure>
  {% include image_tag.html url="/assets/img/units/my_final_plot.png" alt="The final plot" width="60%" %}
  <figcaption>Figure 7 - The final plot with the tufte theme.</figcaption>
</figure>


## Try It Out

Explore creating other graphics in **ggplot2**. Perhaps use the `state.x77` data. Use
the reference page on the **ggplot2** website to try out other geoms and other 
layers.
